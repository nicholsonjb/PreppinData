Due to the comparable commercial successes of both Chin & Beard Suds Co and Your Name (Kimi No Na Wa) we've decided to pull together funding in order to produce a Chin & Beard Suds Co anime to raise our profile even further and hitting that otaku market.
We're aiming to release a short series:
Endless Legend of the Soap Heroes (Kono Sekken Wa Hidoi), 
and a follow up movie: Endless Legend of the Soap Heroes: The Legend's End (Kono Sekken Wa Hidoi: Atsui Gomi No Kaori) by the end of 2022.


However we haven't been able to decide on what genres to theme our anime around. 
We'd like you to help us make this decision by using a bunch of data scrapped from MyAnimeList.net to figure out the most popular genres. We also want to find prime examples of these genres to rip-off copy trace-over just straight up put our own watermark on use for inspiration.

Requirements

Input the data (https://drive.google.com/open?id=13UMTEcPFRsW_okOHk5YZjfUlSy6aviwU).
Consider only TV shows and Movies - we aren't making some straight to video OVA here.
Ignore any anime without a rating or without any genres.
Ignore any anime with less than 10000 viewers (i.e. [Members]) - we expect to have way more than this.
For each genre and type combination (e.g. Action & TV, Romance & Movie) return the following information:
The average rating (to 2 decimal places).
The average viewership (to 0 decimal places).
The maximum rating.
A prime example of the genre and type combination (i.e. the anime with the max rating for the combo).

Output
One output file (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1843TKl7ZUCneyXE08BLR5eCCu6ThI2An).
76 rows (77 including the header).
6 fields:

A snippet of the output.
[Genre]
[Type]
[Avg Rating]
[Max Rating]
[Avg Viewership]
[Prime Example]

Hints
You'll need to split up the [Genre] field and then pivot the results to get the Genre & Type combinations.
On the [Members] field, trying clicking on the 3 dots and filtering on 'Range of Values' to set the viewership cutoff.
To get both average and max ratings you'll either need to duplicate the [Ratings] field or use two separate aggregation steps.
