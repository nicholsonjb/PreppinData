This week, we are putting ourselves in the shoes of a family firm of stock-brokers. 
The firm has a number of branches across the country,
 but thankfully they have learned from previous challenges of Preppin' Data, 
how to put together their lists of their clients purchases. 
The regulators want to know whether there are any 'weird' behaviour from their clients. 
Because their client base is quite small, they have agreed to send a file to the regular where the same 
share has been purchased by multiple customers of the firm. To give the regulator more evidence, 
they will share what percentage that sale makes up of the whole client portfolio of the firm and within the region.
