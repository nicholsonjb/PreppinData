Tableau Prep Work

Tableau Prep is a rapidly developing tool. At the time of writing, the Prep development team is releasing monthly updates to the Prep tool. This means that users are rapidly being challenged to learn and maintain new techniques. When Jonathan asked me what ways are there to practice his Prep skills, we didn't find much and therefore, we will learn as you do.

So what will Preppin' Data involve:

A weekly challenge to manipulate a data set that we provide in to an output that we will publish too. 
On the following week, we will add the solution file to previous week's folder and set a new challenge.
