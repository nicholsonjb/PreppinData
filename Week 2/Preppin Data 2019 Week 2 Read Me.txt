Requirements:
Import the file (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MxosCq-JcWLGtaAcNH2vQPgPvOw_RIWM)
Get rid of those nicely formatted titles - no-one is viewing this in Excel! (sorry Excel fans)
Make sure you get all the data in the Excel sheet loaded in to Prep
Clean up the City names to create two cities in one column (London and Edinburgh)
Pivot the data to give a measure per column for the four metrics in the data set

Output the data to csv
Your output file should:
have 6 columns
have 14 rows of data and a row of headers
Have no cells without a value
Just load beautifully into Tableau
