The Scenario:
Chin & Beard Suds Co (C&BS Co.) is looking to update their company data table which details the monthly profit generated by each product in Scotland and England.
 This has already been done for the first three months of 2019 for Scotland, but the March sales information for England has yet to be aggregated and added to the master table.

The March sales information for England is in its own table and contains how many units of each product type were sold in each city.

The pricing and production costs for each product type are also contained in their own sheet.

The Requirements:
