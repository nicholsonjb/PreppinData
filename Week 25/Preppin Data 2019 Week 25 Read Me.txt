When Lorna (https://twitter.com/lorna_eden) suggested we set-up a challenge for Tableau users to not only complete a Workout Wedesday live but use
Tableau Prep Builder to prepare their data then we jumped at the chance to collaborate. This week is held as a live session
(I'm waving if you are in the room and if you're not here, you're welcome to take part too) so we have built a 
combined challenge that should only take a few hours in total even if you new to either tool.

So what's the challenge?
To celebrate Tableau's Music month (https://www.tableau.com/community/music) Lorna found a great data source on one of her favourite artists (Ed Sheeran) 
that led me to ask a question about one of my faves (Ben Howard). We want to analyse the two artists careers based on their 
touring patterns and as two UK-based singer-songwriters who appeared on the UK music scene at similar times, how have they developed.

The Preppin' Data part
We have taken the gig history from concertarchives.org and done a little pre-cleaning as we wanted the challenge to take a 
suitable amount of time and not be completely imposible. For this challenge we have given you this gigs data along with a file of 
longitudes and latitudes for the location of the city / town hosting the gig. 

By meeting the following requirements you will have your data set ready for the Workout Wednesday challenge:

Requirements

Gigs Data


LongLats Data

Input the data files found here (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qY2UihshPfxwiO29Qao0qMphbiXikUVr)
Join the data sets together
We want to keep all of the 'Gigs Data' even if there isn't a matching Lat / Long
Split LongLat field to form Longitude and Latitude then remove the original LongLat field
Break up the Concert field to find Fellow Artists who performed in the same gig (nb. these artists are split up by a '/') and clean the field up by:
If the Concert does not contain a "/" then Fellow Artists should be blank.
Remove the Artist name (ie get rid of Ben / Ed) from the Fellow Artist field and just leave a blank.
Each Fellow Artist should have their own row (including a null for Ben / Ed as they are THE Artist)
Remove obvious duplicate records (don't group by Concert ID as it's a manual data entry site)
Add in the Home locations for each of our featured artists from here

Output
1747 rows (1748 rows including the header)
11 columns - order of the columns does not matter (as we are preparing this data for desktop)
