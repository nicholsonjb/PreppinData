Preppin' Data 2019: Week 26
Source: https://preppindata.blogspot.com/2019/08/2019-week-26.html
Solution: 

This week's challenge is to NOT USE TYPED CALCULATIONS in Prep to solve the challenge. 
No cheating with copying and pasting formulas either - just use Prep Builder's functionality.

Last night, we went to have a burger at a local restuarant (hi Brickfields in Brockley!!) and I noticed their cocktail menu 
looked ripe for a data prep challenge. What I wanted to understand is the cost of the ingredient linked to the price of the cocktail?


Requirements 

Input the data file (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rspvsJYna87CAkV7FVye8W1aIw78xGI3)
Name the columns 'Cocktails', 'Ingredient' and 'Price respectively 
Seperate the ingredients and create a single column of them
Work out the position of the ingredients within the list of ingredients in each cocktail
Work out the average price of the cocktails that ingredient is used in
Add the original cocktail price back in
Output the file

53 Rows (54 including headers)
