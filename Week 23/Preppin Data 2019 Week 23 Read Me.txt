We need to talk about Dave... he's a good salesman but he's not our analysts' best friend. 
Dave is "too busy" to consistently enter his data. 
He likes to sometimes hit CAPS LOCK. Does Dave even know the shift key exists?

Our challenge this week is to tidy up the messy data Dave has left behind him by creating a nice data set so we can analyse his sales, 
favourite customers etc.
