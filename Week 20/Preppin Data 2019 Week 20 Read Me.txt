This week, Chin & Beard Suds Co. have had a local hospital get in contact about a number of patients who have had an allergic reaction to some of our products. 
As a company who love our customers, we want to cover their medical expenses as we haven't labelled our products clearly enough (or people aren't reading the ingredients).

We have managed to get hold of a list of patients: 


But we need to look at the total cost of their hospital stays. 
A daily cost has been quoted to us, but this differs on the length of stay as there are some admin costs for any new patient: 


Requirements
Use the various input sheets in the Excel file (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ikwJWHbognrb6nrqtmv_OcCO1-D_V5wr)  to build a view of individual cost per day per patient.
Use the scaffold provided to build out a complete data set that includes all days one of our customers is in the hospital
To determine cost, you pay £100 for each of the first three days, then £80 for the next four days and then £75 for each of the following days.
Aggregate the data to form a view of total cost and average cost.

Outputs
Two files: 
1. Daily Hospital Costs
	4 columns
	33 rows of data (34 including headers)
2. Cost per Patient
	3 columns
	9 rows of data (10 including headers)

Here's our output for comparison (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1iaBP8N7YlgsTU4S_Fl-N6OXOSGgLam74).
