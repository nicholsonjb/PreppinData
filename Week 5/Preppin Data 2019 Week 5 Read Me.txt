Preppin' Data 2019: Week 5
Source: https://preppindata.blogspot.com/2019/03/2019-week-5.html
Solution: 

The input for this week's data is from a small financial services company's contact centre who have to measure some key statistics like:

Number of Balances that are being requested
Number of Statements being asked for
Number of complaints being raised


We need to know those numbers by Policy Number and Customer ID so we can see who is using the call centre to hopefully get them on to our website instead to self-service.
When are our busiest days for the contact types above? The data set we are asking you to create will allow you to load that in to Tableau to get those answers - create a viz if you want to!

Requirements:

Input data set (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Rzx-P8o9Xel6H_bF2HziLCXsyabUWqAM)
Create a date per day
Determine how the customer contacted the company
Create a separate column for the Policy Number
Remove contacts that don't have a Policy Number
Identify whether the contact was about a balance check, getting a statement or raising a complaint (it's all our boss cares about)
Get rid of unrequired columns


Output:
15 Rows (16 including the column)
6 Columns
One row per day, per customer and policy
