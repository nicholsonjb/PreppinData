Preppin' Data 2019: Week 27
Source: https://preppindata.blogspot.com/2019/08/2019-week-27.html
Solution: 

At Chin & Beard Suds Co (our Preppin' Data fake company), one of our non-executive directors has asked about the effects of Valentine's Day on our store sales. Sadly, the non-exec director isn't very good with Table Calculations in Tableau Desktop so we have promised a data set to allow them to build their own views with all of the calculations pre-computed.

Here's the dashboard the non-exec director wants:

Here's my version (https://public.tableau.com/profile/carl.allchin#!/vizhome/ChinBeardValentineAnalysis/FebSalesChinBeard)

Requirements:

Input the Data (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tUTG0-A9Q37abfaCdHyFq_7wApnWIIEX)
Determine if the sales date is pre- or post- Valentine's day
Work out the running total of sales for each store, restarting after Valentine's day to allow us to compare the two 14 day periods
Output:

One data set (and dashboard for bonus points - remember no table calcs!)
Your output date should have:
56 rows (57 including headers)
5 columns:
Date
Store
Pre / Post Valentine's day flag
Daily Sales Value
Running Sales Value (remember this should restart per store and post-Valentine's day)
For comparison, here's our output files. (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tPoD1dkNMuivnt41DiSTtXqaPtioXVdl)
Hint
If you haven't tried to build a Running Total in Prep Builder before then this blog might help (https://preppindata.blogspot.com/2019/07/2019-week-22-solution.html)
