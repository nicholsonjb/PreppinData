Preppin' Data 2019: Week 3
Source: https://preppindata.blogspot.com/2019/02/2019-week-3.html
Solution: 


Scenario:
You work for a mobile / cell phone company. You boss asks you to pull together the revenue report of your current batch of contracts (sadly there are only four contracts!). 
They need to know how much revenue is generated each month from these contracts whilst they are 'live' (ie from their start date until 'x' months in the future when the contract runs out).
The aim of the week is to be able to create a chart like this but with all the data prep work done in Tableau Prep Builder. If you think that is simple - here's the input data:

Requirements:

Import the file (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PC6CXAmzCXpp1Xn8b06400XPTWkroRR6/view?usp=sharing)
Make sure you use both sheets
Use one sheet to help you create a row of data for each month the person's contract is 'live' for
Remove unnecessary fields of data
Output for use within Tableau Desktop
Recreate the viz (https://public.tableau.com/views/PreppinData-Week3/MobilePhonePayments?:embed=y&:display_count=yes&publish=yes)


Your output file should:
Have five columns
Have fifty-five rows of data (including the headers)
Be at the person, per month level of detail
Have no cells without a value
Save as a .tde or .hyper file (csv if you are not going to build the view in Tableau Desktop)
