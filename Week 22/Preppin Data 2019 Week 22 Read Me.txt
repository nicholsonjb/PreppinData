As heavy Tableau users at Chin & Beard Suds Co, our users keep asking us to show if it is possible to create a Moving Average. 
As any Tableau User will know, this is super easy to set up in a table calculation (https://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/calculations_tablecalculations.htm)
 but harder to do at the data preparation stage to hard code that value for use in other calculations that you might want to have
 happen earlier in Tableau's Order of Operations (https://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-gb/order_of_operations.htm).

Therefore, this week is focused on our daily sales at the start of 2019 and how we can work out the weekly average 
(using the 7 days before the current date) to work that out.

Requirements

Input Data (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mcPysMSByvguuvu7BY85oQZrMg3MJE_-)
Determine the weekly average sales for the current day and the previous six
Don't create a moving average if it isn't the average of seven days sales.
Clean-up the data for output by removing unnecessary columns

Outputs
One file
3 columns
365 rows (366 rows including header)

Hints (only read if you need too)
To create the rows necessary - use a join to create additional rows with each days sales that will be used in the moving average.
You shouldn't need a scaffold based on your join logic (ie it's a join condition that isn't '=')
